Expert Tips
It’s important to create a slurry with the flour and broth so the mixture will blend in with meat mixture in the skillet without forming lumps. Bringing everything to a boil thickens the skillet dish and cooking it for a minute or two cooks away any raw flour taste.
A hearty dash of Worcestershire sauce really enhances meat-based dishes. It’s a liquid condiment that offers a rich, savory flavor to meat dishes and beverages (it’s made from garlic, soy sauce, onion, molasses, anchovies, and vinegar).
The sirloin steak is easier to slice if it’s partially frozen. The steak strips cook fast and after a short simmer will result in a quick and easy week night dinner.
Sautéing the aromatics (garlic and onion) first helps define their taste by taking their pungent edge off and allowing them to develop a natural sweetness.
White button mushrooms are delicious in the creamy sauce; for a different flavor, try shiitakes (remove the stems and slice them) instead.

Instructions
Make the meat sauce. Add the beef and sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until meat is browned, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the fat from the meat.
Add the sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, and black pepper to the skillet with the cooked meat. Stir well.
Add the tomato paste. Stir until no large clumps of tomato paste remain.
Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir until well combined. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the minced parsley.
As the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta al dente according to its package directions. Drain the pasta well, and return it to the large pot used for boiling.
Pour the meat sauce over the pasta. Stir well. Add the parmesan cheese to the pasta. Stir well. Let the spaghetti rest in the meat sauce for 5 minutes before serving to let the pasta absorb some of the sauce.

Chicken Fried Rice

INGREDIENTS:
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
3/4 to 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups frozen peas and diced carrots blend (I don’t thaw and use straight from the freezer)
3 green onions, trimmed and sliced into thin rounds
2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
4 cups cooked rice (I use white, long-grain or brown may be substituted. To save time use two 8.8-ounce pouches cooked and ready-to-serve rice)
3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
salt and pepper, optional and to taste

DIRECTIONS:
To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, chicken, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 to 5 minutes, flipping intermittently so all sides cook evenly. Cooking time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts and sizes of pieces. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices from chicken to remain in skillet) and place chicken on a plate; set aside.
Add the peas, carrots, green onions, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.

Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.
Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.
Add the chicken, rice, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, optional salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is reheated through. Recipe is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently as desired.

Mac N Cheese

Ingredients

▢½ lb uncooked elbow macaroni , about 1 ½ cups
▢3 tablespoons butter
▢2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
▢1/2 teaspoon salt
▢1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
▢1 1/2 cup milk , any kind
▢3/4 cup half and half
▢2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese *


US Customary - Metric
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.
Cook the macaroni to al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.
Slowly add the milk and half and half, stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes until the mixture is just barely thickened. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until melted.
Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.

Notes
Tips for getting a smooth cheese sauce:
High quality aged cheddar cheese will give you a stronger taste and smoother texture. More mild and inexpensive cheddar cheeses will have less flavor and almost a grittier taste.
Use fresh grated cheese. Pre-shredded store-bought cheese will not melt the same as freshly grated cheese, and grating the cheese helps it melt smoothly and evenly in the sauce.
Bring the cheese to room temperature. I like to grate the cheese very first, before moving forward with the recipe. That allows it to sit at room temperature while I prepare the white sauce.
Use low heat. In order for the cheese to melt properly and smoothly we want it to have gradual changes in temperature (like how we shredded it and allowed it to come to room temperature at the beginning of the recipe). When it’s time to add the cheese to the white sauce, remove the sauce from heat and let it cool for a few minutes. It only needs to be warm enough to melt the cheese.
Don’t over-stir the sauce once the cheese has melted. Add the noodles and quickly assemble in pan and put into the oven.

Baked Chicken 
chicken breast seasoning
You only need a handful of seasoning ingredients for this one: paprika (mild, sweet or smoky), brown sugar (or a brown sugar substitute for Keto readers), oregano (or Thyme), onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.

Adapted from our Cajun Butter Chicken recipe without the heat! Of course, you can add the heat if you desire!

All of these ingredients together smothered all over your chicken breasts makes MAGIC and the perfect balance. The brown sugar lets the chicken sweat while baking, making our baked chicken breast even juicer! Much like our your favourite Chili Lime Chicken.

how long to cook chicken breasts
Large chicken breasts (7oz or 200g) take about 20-22 minutes to cook. Medium-sized breasts (5 – 6oz or 150 – 180g) take about 18-20 minutes. You also have the option of throwing on your broiler in the last 2 minutes to get  crispier edges!

Cooking them at high heat ensures the crispy, caramelised edges, while keeping your chicken super juicy on the inside. Once the chicken is golden and caramelised, it’s cooked! Let it rest for about 5 minutes to recirculate all of those natural juices through the meat.

Pork Chops

YOU WILL NEED
4 pork chops, about 1-inch thick and 6 to 7 ounces each, see notes

Salt, to taste

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon chili powder, see our homemade chili powder recipe

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 cup low-sodium chicken stock, see our homemade chicken stock recipe

1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

2 teaspoons honey or brown sugar

1 tablespoon butter

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, optional


DIRECTIONS
PREPARE PORK CHOPS
Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt and pepper — we use just less than 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt per pork chop. Set the chops aside to rest for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the spice rub. In a small bowl, mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika. After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to pat the pork chops dry then rub both sides of the chops with the spice rub.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet (with lid) over medium-high heat. As soon as the oil is hot and looks shimmery, add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. (If there is a fattier side of the pork, use kitchen tongs to hold the chops, fat-side-down until it sizzles and browns slightly; about 30 seconds.) Reduce the heat to low then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reads 145 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the chop. (Since cook time depends on the thickness of the chops, check for doneness at 5 minutes then go from there, checking every 2 minutes). If you do not have a thermometer, you will know they are done, if when cutting into the chops, the juices run clear.

Transfer pork chops to a plate then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes.

MAKE PAN SAUCE
While the pork rests, make the pan sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high then add the chicken stock, vinegar, and honey. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan so that any stuck bits of pork come up. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Taste then adjust the seasoning with salt, more vinegar or honey. Slide the skillet off of the heat and when the sauce is no longer simmering, swirl in the butter. Slide the pork chops back into the pan and spoon some of the sauce on top. Alternatively, slice the chops then place back into the pan. Scatter fresh parsley over the pork then serve.

ADAM AND JOANNE'S TIPS
What pork chops to use: We call for 1-inch thick chops in the recipe, but you can use thinner or thicker chops as a substitute. Keep in mind that thinner chops will cook much quicker, so keep your thermometer close by. Bone-in chops are an excellent option, too. The bone will add a minute or two of extra cook time.
Can I use my favorite spice rub? Yes, absolutely. Just make sure the spice rub is salt-free.
Gluten-free: If you don’t want to use the flour, it’s okay. The crust won’t be as even, but skipping the flour and just rubbing the spices over the pork will still taste great.
Make an onion-apple pan sauce: After removing the cooked pork chops from the skillet, add sliced onions, apples and a bit of fresh thyme. Cook until sweet and softened then pour in the stock, vinegar, and honey.

Expert Tips
For a "no last-minute" mashed potato casserole, spoon prepared potatoes into greased 2-quart casserole; cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours. About an hour before serving, heat oven to 350°F, drizzle potatoes with 2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter and bake for 40 to 45 minutes until hot. Stir potatoes before serving. Now that's easy!

XXL Death by Chocolate Cookie


Ingredients

2 Tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
2 Tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar
2 Tablespoons (25g) packed light or dark brown sugar
2 Tablespoons beaten egg (crack an egg, beat it, and use 2 Tablespoons)
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup (32g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
2 Tablespoons (11g) natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup (55g) dark chocolate chips + 1 Tablespoon, divided (or semi-sweet chocolate chips)
optional: sprinkles
Instructions
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Set aside.
In a medium size bowl, mix the softened butter and sugars together with a spoon or fork until creamed. Mix in the egg and vanilla.
In a separate small bowl, mix the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix to combine. Fold in 1/4 cup chocolate chips.
Place the dough in the center of the baking sheet and mold into a tall ball using a spoon (see picture above). Dot the top of the cookie with 1 Tablespoon of chocolate chips. Add sprinkles on top if desired. Bake for 14-15 minutes, or up to 16 minutes. The cookie will appear very soft, but will firm up as it cools. Allow to cool completely on baking sheet.
Notes
Smaller Cookies: You may make four smaller cookies using this recipe. Just divide the dough into 4 smaller mounds on the cookie sheet rather than 1 large mound. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
Whole Batch: Want to make a whole batch of chocolate cookies? Use my easy Inside Out Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe and swap the white chocolate chips for semi-sweet, if desired.
